# Final Major Project Formative


**Name:** Ben Louka

**Student no:** 96292215

**Course:** BA (Hons) Web Media, Level 3

**Unit Code:** WEB14303 Final Major Project

<br>

For this unit I am very excited of what I will produce at the end of the unit. The app I am creating a personal app to me and is something I am passionate about. I know there will be some difficulties along the way, especially as I have never created an app before, but I will hopefully overcome these obstacles and produce a professional piece of work.

### User personas

The target market I have chosen is 16 - 24 years olds, but also as my app is used by parents etc, they will also be in my target audience. Below is an example of my audiences.
